## 🚀 Demo Result

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/cover-image.jpg" alt="Imagen3 Demo" width="100%">
</div>

The following image was generated using this prompt:

> A low-angle close-up shot, in stark black and white, focuses on a woman with a short, precisely cut bob. Her expression is one of deep concern; her eyebrows are slightly furrowed, her mouth drawn into a thin line, and her eyes hold a worried intensity. The high contrast of the black and white photography emphasizes the texture of her skin and the lines around her eyes, accentuating her worried expression. The background is a blurred but imposing array of tall skyscrapers, their forms rendered in varying shades of grey, creating a sense of depth and scale.
